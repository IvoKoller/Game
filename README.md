# Game


This is the repo for my upcoming "Maturaproject" game. Enjoy!

In order to compile the game one may have to install the following dependecies:

-GL 
-GLU 
-GLEW 
-glfw3 
-X11 
-Xxf86vm 
-Xrandr 
-pthread 
-Xi 
-dl 
-Xinerama 
-Xcursor 
-freeimage 
-freetype 
-ogg 
-vorbis 
-vorbisfile 
-openal

then, open the terminal, navigate to /Core and enter the command

*make game*

then enter

*./game* 

to run it. As this might be difficult to do, I offer to showcase the 
functionality of the game engine, the editor and the game.
